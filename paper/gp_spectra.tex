\section{Introduction}

Motivations/goals. By pooling information about stars we can:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Denoise to avoid excessively harsh signal-to-noise cuts. \bdw{not sure I understand why we highlight this reason. Generically, we can use the data-driven GP mixture model to denoise and thus enhance the data, potentially enabling new discoveries. This should work for high S/N and low S/N regions; how useful this is depends on the size of the effects we may want to discover}. What is the current minimum S/N considered useful?
\item Inpaint masked regions of spectra to make, e.g., abundance measurements that would otherwise be impossible.
\item Determine the most informative regions of spectra to, e.g., determine whether we can retain sensitivity to abundances by observing a reduced spectral range.
\end{enumerate}

How will we do this? By modeling the spectra as a data-driven Gaussian Process. What is a GP and what are relevant applications.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Methods}

Describe Gaussian Process. True spectrum for each star is drawn from a GP with a mean spectrum and covariance matrix to be inferred from the data. We do not assume a kernel for our GP covariance, but rather infer the correlations between the observed spectral bins. This is so we can model the exact covariance and not worry about suboptimal choices of kernels caused by non-stationarity or different correlation lengths, line shapes, etc. The main downside of doing this is we can not make predictions for the spectra between the observed bins, though we could, given data observed on shifted or irregularly or different-spaced grids. We assume uninformative priors on the mean and covariance. We adopt an infinite uniform prior on the mean and a Jeffreys prior on the covariance matrix (precise form in notes).

Data are observed with Gaussian noise that is uncorrelated between spectral bins; masked pixels are assigned unit flux and effectively infinite noise uncertainties. These data, the inferred parameters, the likelihood and priors would fully specify the model if we had only one class. To account for the fact that the red clump might consist of multiple distinct populations (or one population whose distribution of true spectra is non-Gaussian) we allow for multiple classes to exist in our model. In this instance, each star is also assigned membership to a particular class. Class memberships are drawn from categorical distributions, with class probabilities drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter $\alpha=1$.

The network diagram for our hierarchical Bayesian model is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:network_diagram}, and the probability distributions defining each link are set out in Table.~\ref{tab:prob_dists}. The particular set of probability distributions chosen allow for the conditional distributions of each latent variable to be written analytically, and we hence use Gibbs sampling to estimate the joint posterior.

\section{Data}

We take 29502 red clump stars identified in the APOGEE dataset. The contamination from non-red-clump stars is expected to be on the order of X percent.Describe pre-processing. The spectra cover the range 15100.80-16999.81 \AA, using $\nb = 8575$ spectral bins. Inversion of the resulting $\nb \times \nb$ covariance matrices would be too slow to permit inference, and we thus restrict our analysis to a set of spectral windows centred on lines confidently assigned to individual elements. Specifically, we process all spectral bins within $\pm2.5$ \AA\ of the line centres tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:window_centres}, reducing the number of spectral bins to $\nb = 557$ and hence inversion time by a factor of $\sim3500$.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Validation}

To avoid the complications of comparing data gathered by different spectrographs we validate our model and code by artificially masking a portion of one of our APOGEE spectra, namely the 15789 \AA\ Cerium window of our lowest-SNR star (2M18335753-1302240). The measured data for this star are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:recovery_test} as a solid black line, with the artificially masked region picked out as a dashed line. The 68\% credible interval for the posterior probability on the star's true spectrum is plotted as dark grey, with the corresponding prediction for the observed spectrum (which also takes into account the uncertainty on the observations) plotted in light grey. This prediction (the posterior predictive distribution of the measured data) is in excellent agreement with the measured data, indicating that our model is capable of inpainting masked regions without bias. Note, in addition, that the uncertainty on the true spectrum is much smaller than the measurement noise, demonstrating our method's ability to denoise observed spectra.

    \caption{Recovery test. Artificially masking the 15789 \AA\ Cerium window (indicated by vertical dotted lines) for the lowest-SNR star results in an inferred true spectrum (dark-grey shaded region) that is entirely in agreement with the measurement (solid black line) once noise is taken into account (light-grey shaded region).}
    \label{fig:recovery_test}
\end{figure}

\subsection{APOGEE Inference}

\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth]{apogee_centers_subset2_ce_nd_29502_spc_low_rank_covariance.pdf}
    \caption{Mean-posterior covariance matrix (left), its low-rank approximation (centre) constructed from all eigenvectors with eigenvalues within $10^{-4}$ of the largest, and the residuals (right).}
    \label{fig:inferred_cov}
\end{figure*}

Our inference produces samples of the probability, mean spectrum and covariance matrix for each class considered, and the true spectrum and class membership of each object. Focusing initially on the single-class case, we plot our covariance and mean inference in Figures~\ref{fig:inferred_cov} and~\ref{fig:gp_reals}, respectively. We plot the mean-posterior covariance matrix in Figure~\ref{fig:inferred_cov} (left panel). The covariance has strong off-diagonal structure, indicating that certain spectral features are highly correlated and anti-correlated ({\bf discuss potential kernel choices?}). Its eigenspectrum also decays rapidly: only 241 of 557 eigenmodes have eigenvalues larger than  1/100 of the maximum. A low-rank approximation to the mean covariance retaining only these eigenmodes is plotted in the centre panel of Figure~\ref{fig:inferred_cov}, and the resulting residuals (multiplied by a factor of 500 to render visible) in the right panel. Exploiting this decaying eigenspectrum by assuming the covariance is rank deficient would greatly reduce computation time (by a factor of roughly 12 if 241 modes were retained). Na\"ively projecting the data onto the largest principal components of the sample covariance matrix prior to inference severely degrades performance. Modifying the hierarchical model (along the lines of {\bf citations}) to explicitly infer a rank-deficient covariance matrix is left to future work.

    \caption{Mean-posterior mean spectrum (black), and 50 realizations drawn from our Gaussian Process model, conditioned on the APOGEE data, coloured purple to yellow according to their flux in the first spectral bin.}
    \label{fig:gp_reals}
\end{figure*}

The posterior mean of the mean spectrum is plotted in black in Figure~\ref{fig:gp_reals}. The mean spectrum is extremely well constrained: its 68\% credible interval is narrower than the width of line. To illustrate the covariance structure captured by our model, we overlay 50 realizations drawn from our Gaussian-Process model conditioned on the APOGEE data, colour-coded by the value they take in the first spectral bin. These samples can be interpreted as examples of potential noiseless true spectra that could have led to the data. They illustrate the variability permitted by the model and highlight certain clear trends, most notably highly correlated differences in line depths.
